# ðŸ§  Vector Operations with NumPy â€“ Personal Math Foundations

This notebook demonstrates practical vector operations using NumPy as part of my foundational learning in **Linear Algebra for Machine Learning**. It aligns with exercises from the DeepLearning.AI "Mathematics for ML and Data Science" specialization on Coursera.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Included

This notebook covers:

- Vector creation (`row`, `column`, 1D vs 2D)
- L1 Norm (Manhattan distance)
- L2 Norm (Euclidean length)
- Dot product
- Cosine similarity (direction between vectors)

All concepts are implemented and tested manually using NumPy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This notebook is part of my personal study log. I'm not teaching, just showcasing what I've built while learning.

- âœ… Reproducible vector examples
- âœ… Clean NumPy implementation
- âœ… Direct mapping from theory to code
- âœ… Prepared for future ML use cases (loss functions, embeddings, etc.)
