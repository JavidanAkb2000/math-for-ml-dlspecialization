# ðŸ§  Math for Machine Learning â€“ DeepLearning.AI Specialization

This repository contains my lab notebooks and notes from the [Math for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science) by DeepLearning.AI.

Each week includes hands-on practice with core concepts in:
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Probability & Statistics
- Optimization

All code is written in Python using NumPy, and tested in Jupyter/Colab environments.
