- NumPy Array Fundamentals – Week 1

This notebook contains my lab from **Week 1** of the [Math for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) by DeepLearning.AI.

 --- ✅ Topics Covered:
- NumPy array creation: `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.empty`, `np.full`
- Indexing, slicing, and broadcasting
- Memory views: `a[:]` vs `a[::]`
- Differences between `np.zeros()` and `np.empty()`

Notebook written and tested in Google Colab.
