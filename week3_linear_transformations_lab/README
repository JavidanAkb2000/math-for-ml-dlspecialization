# 🧮 Week 3 — Linear Transformations Lab  
**Math for Machine Learning — DeepLearning.AI Specialization**

> Build your intuition for linear transformations in geometry and neural networks with hands-on coding and visualization.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This lab helps you develop both geometric and algebraic intuition about linear transformations — essential tools for understanding how neural networks process data.

---

## 📚 Contents

- **Vectors & Linear Transformations**  
  Understand transformations as functions between vector spaces.  
  Matrix-based mappings:  
  ```python
  T(v) = A @ v
  ```
  Visualize transformations on 2D vectors and images.

- **Standard Basis & Matrix Construction**  
  Use standard basis vectors (e₁, e₂) to construct transformation matrices by examining their transformed images.

- **2D Image Transformations**  
  Apply transformations to 2D images (as matrices of points):  
  - Horizontal/vertical scaling  
  - Scalar stretching  
  - Reflections (x/y axes)  
  - Arbitrary-angle rotation  
  Visualize all transformations.

- **Math Operations Recap**  
  - Matrix multiplication for transformations  
  - Vector broadcasting & reshaping  
  - Efficient implementation with NumPy

## 🤖 Neural Network Connection

- **Forward Propagation from Scratch**
  - Implement linear forward pass:
    ```python
    Z = W @ X + b
    Y_hat = Z
    ```
  - Build a minimal neural network:
    - Parameter initialization
    - Forward pass
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost
    - Manual weight updates (`utils.train_nn`)
