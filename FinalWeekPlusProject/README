# 🧠 Face Compression with PCA – Final Project

This is a **pure NumPy** implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to face images.  
It's the **final project** I built after completing the [Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/linear-algebra-for-machine-learning-and-data-science/) course by DeepLearning.AI.

The goal:  
> 💡 Compress high-dimensional face images and reconstruct them using only the most important components — all done from scratch, using linear algebra principles.

## 📚 What This Project Covers

I applied **everything I learned** in the course, including:

- ✅ Vector and matrix operations  
- ✅ Centering the data  
- ✅ Covariance matrix computation  
- ✅ Eigenvalue & eigenvector decomposition  
- ✅ Dimensionality reduction via PCA  
- ✅ Image compression and reconstruction  
- ✅ Visualization and interpretation of results

## 📦 Dataset

- **Olivetti Faces Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
- Contains 400 grayscale images, 64×64 pixels each
- Flattened to 4096-dimensional vectors

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- **NumPy only** — no `sklearn.PCA`, no black boxes  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (only for loading the dataset)

## 🚀 How PCA Was Implemented

1. **Flattening**: Converted each 64×64 image into a 4096D vector  
2. **Centering**: Subtracted the mean face  
3. **Covariance**: Built the full 4096×4096 covariance matrix  
4. **Eigen Decomposition**: Extracted eigenvalues & eigenvectors  
5. **Projection**: Reduced dimensionality (k = 50)  
6. **Reconstruction**: Rebuilt the face from compressed representation  
7. **Visualization**: Compared original vs reconstructed faces

---

## 🎯 Key Result

- Reduced face vectors from **4096 → 50 dimensions**
- Preserved facial identity and structure
- Reconstructed image shows high similarity to original

| Original | Reconstructed (k=50) |
|----------|----------------------|
| ![original](./images/original_face.png) | ![reconstructed](./images/reconstructed_face.png) |

## 📜 Certificate

This project is a hands-on demonstration of what I learned in the DeepLearning.AI Linear Algebra course.  
It helped me deeply understand how PCA works **under the hood** and gave me practical intuition for applying linear algebra in ML workflows.
